# CMSC829A project - alternative tree distance metrics for Sgootr
## Introduction
This project is created to explore alternative tree distance metrics to evalute phylogeny tree stability in [Sgootr](https://github.com/liuy0421/Sgootr)(Liu et al., 2022).
## Data Availability
Input newick files were generated using [Sgootr](https://github.com/liuy0421/Sgootr) on single-cell bisulfite sequencing data published by Bian et al. Input files are available upon request.
